    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>My appreciation of food as medicine has evolved from many years of studying nutrition and working with over 200 individuals as a wellness and fitness coach to help them better understand their bodies nutritional and wellness needs.</p>
    <p>Early on in my 20's I was challenged to get to the root cause of my own body's ailments. I dealt with gut discomfort fo ryears and after numerous doctors handing me prescriptions that did nothing to cure my discomfort, I decided to take initiative and ownership of my body's cry for help. After many food elimination trials and errors, I was able to determine my food sensitivites and finally regain control over how food made me feel. Becoming my own advocate for my physical resiliency is what became my motivation to learn as much as I could to guide others to find their resilient wellness.</p>

    <p>I believe in the importance of nourishing our bodies with whole foods that are not only healthy, but taste delicious. Through my personal love of food and cooking, I educate and teach individuals how to understand foods, plan, cook and enjoy healthy meals at home and on the go. I believe the more you fall in love with food and what it can do for your well being then the more you will fall in love with YOU!</p>

    <h2>TESTIMONIALS</h2>
      <p>- Beth has dedicated herself to helping others imporve their overall health through fitness and mindful eating of real food. She practices what she preaches but has never claimed a "one program fits all approach" to fitness or diet. She meets people where they are and is particularly attuned to the mental and emotional struggles that women face as they work towards their personal goals. Her enthusiasm and spirit are palpable, a rare and wonderful gift to those she encounter! <em><strong>Jenna, Age 27</em></strong></p>

      <p>- Beth is unlike any other health and wellness professional out there. Her attention to her client's needs is above reporoach. There is no one size fits all with Beth, she will tailor make a program to fit your goals. Her holistic approach ensures that the entire mind, body, and soul are covered. She's passionate about her profession and it's impossible not to jump on the band wagon with her. <em><strong>Ilene, Age 33</em></strong></p>

      <p>- As my behavioral health business began to grow, the number on the scale began to rise for me as well. Coupled with the face that my mother passed away at the young age of 57, due to obesity, I knew that I had to change my lifestyle. As a busy entrepreneur, I struggled to find a consistent workout routine and find time to cook healthy food. Beth taught me that there is not "magic diet" to weight-loss. A trendy diet may seem tempting, but it does not create the long-lasting positive lifestyle I was trying to create for myself. Beth taught me how to meal plan and increased my confidence with cooking. With the focus on lifestyle, and not so much on my weight. I began to eat healthy and suddenly we realized I was down 15-pounds! Next month, I will be doing a my first triathlon. A feat that I would have never attempted without the support from Beth's life-changing fitness coaching. <em><strong>Jenn, Age 32</em></strong></p>
